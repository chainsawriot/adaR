adaR is a wrapper for [ada-url](https://github.com/ada-url/ada), a
[WHATWG](https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#url-parsing)-compliant and fast
URL parser written in modern C++ .

It implements several auxilliary functions to work with urls:

-   public suffix extraction (top level domain excluding private
    domains) like [psl](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/psl)
-   fast c++ implementation of `utils::URLdecode` (\~40x speedup)

## Installation

You can install the development version of adaR from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("schochastics/adaR")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows all the returned components of a URL

``` r
library(adaR)
ada_url_parse("https://user_1:password_1@example.org:8080/dir/../api?q=1#frag")
#>                                                      href protocol username
#> 1 https://user_1:password_1@example.org:8080/api?q=1#frag   https:   user_1
#>     password             host    hostname port pathname search  hash
#> 1 password_1 example.org:8080 example.org 8080     /api   ?q=1 #frag
```

``` cpp
  /*
   * https://user:pass@example.com:1234/foo/bar?baz#quux
   *       |     |    |          | ^^^^|       |   |
   *       |     |    |          | |   |       |   `----- hash_start
   *       |     |    |          | |   |       `--------- search_start
   *       |     |    |          | |   `----------------- pathname_start
   *       |     |    |          | `--------------------- port
   *       |     |    |          `----------------------- host_end
   *       |     |    `---------------------------------- host_start
   *       |     `--------------------------------------- username_end
   *       `--------------------------------------------- protocol_end
   */
```

It solves some problems of urltools with more complex urls.

``` r
urltools::url_parse("https://www.google.com/maps/place/Pennsylvania+Station/@40.7519848,-74.0015045,14.
   7z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x89c259ae15b2adcb:0x7955420634fd7eba!8m2!3d40.750568!4d-73.993519")

A “raw” url parse using ada is extremely fast (see
[ada-url.com](https://www.ada-url.com/)) but the implemented interface
is not yet optimized. The performance is still very compatible with
`urltools::url_parse` with the noted advantage in accuracy in some
practical circumstances.

``` r
bench::mark(
  ada = replicate(1000, ada_url_parse("https://user_1:password_1@example.org:8080/dir/../api?q=1#frag", decode = FALSE)),
  urltools = replicate(1000, urltools::url_parse("https://user_1:password_1@example.org:8080/dir/../api?q=1#frag")),
  iterations = 1, check = FALSE
)
#> Warning: Some expressions had a GC in every iteration; so filtering is
#> disabled.

## Public Suffix extraction

`public_suffix()` takes urls and returns their top level domain from the
[public suffix list](https://publicsuffix.org/), **excluding** private
domains. This functionality already exists in the R package
[psl](https://github.com/hrbrmstr/psl) and
[urltools](https://cran.r-project.org/package=urltools).

psl relies on a C library an is lighning fast. Hoewver, the package is
not on CRAN and has the C lib as a system requirement. If these are no
issues for you and you need that speed, please use that package.

the performance of urltools for that task is quite comparable to psl,
but it does rely on a different set of top level domains (to the best of
our knowledge, it does include private domains).

Overall, both packages over higher performance for this task. This comes
with no surprise, since our extractor is written in base R. Public
suffix extraction is not the main objective of this package, yet we
wanted to include a function for this task without introducing new
dependencies.
